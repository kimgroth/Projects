# Simple To-Do CLI

This is a small interactive command line application written in Python. It keeps
your tasks in memory for the duration of the session.

## Usage

Run the application using Python:

```bash
python todo.py
```

Then use the following commands:

- `add <task description>` – add a new task.
- `list` or `view` – display current tasks.
- `done <task id>` – mark a task as done.
- `exit` – quit the program.

Tasks are stored only in memory, so they disappear when you exit the program.
